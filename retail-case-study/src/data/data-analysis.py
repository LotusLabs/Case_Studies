# # Retail Case Study - Data Analysis
# This notebook contains an exploratory data analysis for the retail case study.
#
# ## Data
# Data can be found at this address: https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset

# ### Content 
# You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.

# Within the Excel Sheet, there are 3 Tabs â€“ Stores, Features and Sales

# ### Stores

# * Store - the store number
# * Date - the week
# * Temperature - average temperature in the region
# * Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
# * MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA
